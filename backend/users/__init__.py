# users/__init__.py
# This file indicates that the 'users' directory should be treated as a Python package.

default_app_config = 'users.apps.UsersConfig'

# You could also make key components available at the package level, for example:
# from .models import CustomUser, UserRole
# __all__ = ['CustomUser', 'UserRole']
# However, explicit imports are generally preferred.
